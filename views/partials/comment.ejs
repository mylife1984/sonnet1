 As you can tell we are hiring.  And we are looking for VERY smart people.

 Of all the applicants we received this year you might be just one of them.
 Set yourself apart.
 Share your out-of-the-office projects in your resume or cover letter if they represent your skillset well.
 Include open source projects you've worked on.  Or start one before you apply.  It helps.

 Great engineers prefer to work with other great engineers.  We take that seriously.
 We also like beer and robots.
